            <p>While recent tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza have led to an increased presence of antisemitism in the United States and around the world, antisemitic incidents have been on the rise since long before the events of October 7th. Jewish people across the country are facing rising antisemitism year after year. The Anti-Defamation League is an anti-hate organization that was founded in 1913 with the goal of fighting all forms of antisemitism and bias. Though the report for 2023 is not available yet, the Anti-Defamation League publishes their report entitled, "Audit of Antisemitic Incidents" yearly. This report shares data about different types of antisemitic incidents that have been reported to them throughout the year.</p>

            <p>The total number of antisemitic incidents that occurred in each state in the year 2022 reveals that New York reported the most incidents with California being the second highest reporting state.</p>

            <p>The total number of antisemitic incidents reported in the United States has also increased over time from 2019 to 2022. The ADL saw about an 82.5% increase in incidents from 2020 to 2022. This number includes reported assaults, acts of vandalism, and harassment motivated by antisemitism. Since 2020, the United States and Jewish Americans have faced a steady increase in attacks against the Jewish community and the trend is likely continuing as the war in Israel further fuels antisemitic rhetoric and ideologies.</p>

            <p>The prevalence of antisemitism in local communities can be seen by looking at incidents reported in the state of New York. In 2022, New York was the state that reported the highest number of total incidents. With tensions continuing to rise as a result of the fighting in the Middle East, the effects of antisemitism are being felt in the local Syracuse community. The executive director of the Sam Pomeranz Jewish Community Center of Syracuse, Marci Erlebacher, says concerns for safety in an around the JCC complex have been at the forefront of the minds of the Jewish patrons.</p>
            <p>"We have intensified our security a little bit and we will see more armed guards around the building," Erlebacher said.</p>

            <p>Incidents of religious bias disproportionately affect members of the Jewish community in comparison to other prominent religions in the United States. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations also posts a report of hate crime statistics which provides data for hate crimes motivated by different factors including race, religion, sexual orientation and gender among other motivators. In their 2019 report, the FBI found that 62.7% of religious bias incidents were aimed towards the Jewish community.</p>

            <p>Antisemitism is an issue that the Jewish community in the United States and around the world has faced since long before the most recent conflict in the Middle East.While this may have increased the number of incidents in recent months, this trend of an increase in antisemitism in the United States has been going on for years. Erlebacher says the recent uptick in antisemitism has further encouraged the Jewish community to come together and support one another.</p>
